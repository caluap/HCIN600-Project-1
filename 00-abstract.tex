Climate change is an increasingly hot topic, impacting a wide range of fields. In this study, we are interested in querying computing students views on the issue: what are challenges and opportunities as the field adapts itself to climate change? We conducted a series of interviews that revealed that students agree that it is an urgent issue, but they feel that it would not have major impacts in their field. The adaptations that were suggested are of a generally more superficial nature, lacking a structural understanding of the challenges of the climate change, and students do not generally feel that they themselves could initiate action.
