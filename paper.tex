\section{Introduction}

As its harsh realities spread %dizzyingly 
over everyday life, climate change has become a dominant theme in societal discourse. While discussions of the extent of the damage already done, our shared future prospects, and possible mitigation strategies are still highly politically charged, even traditionally denialist blocs have started acknowledging that \emph{something} must be done. \cite{teirstein_2021} 

In computing, the discussion about how the field is related to and could potentially act on climate change is not new but has become more prominent in recent years. In the \textsc{acm} Digital Library, for instance, 295 climate change-related papers were published from 1991 to 2009, with 2,095 then published from 2010 to 2020. \cite{ferreiraClimateChangeCommunication2021} As a complex, multi-variate issue, different researchers adopt varied approaches about what role computing could, or should, play. \citet{easterbrook2010climate} argues that the software community has to ``step up to the plate,'' as other fields have done, and calls for a discipline-wide effort on work on three areas: 
    \begin{quote}
        Software to support the science of understanding climate change; software to support the global collective decision making; and software to reduce the carbon footprint of modern technology.
    \end{quote}

This fits what \citet{silberman2010precarious} call \emph{adaptation-oriented pre-apocalyptic computing}, which assumes a future apocalypse\footnote{The term, which the authors acknowledge as perhaps too \emph{inflammatory} for scholarly use, ``denotes an event in the intersection of the spaces of events denoted by the terms \emph{collapse} and \emph{disaster}.''} is likely, but attempts to ``develop tools for users to negotiate it successfully,'' making it ``less apocalyptic [with] materials and social relations available at design time (pre-apocalypse) but likely to be unavailable at use time.'' An alternative approach, \emph{adaptation-oriented post-apocalyptic computing} works within material constraints as if the apocalypse had already happened, thus anticipating and easing a transition towards future conditions --- which, interestingly, makes this approach share methods with the already-present realities of ``disaster informatics, community informatics, \textsc{ict4d}, \textsc{hci4d}, humanitarian logistics, sociotechnical action research and `post normal science.'''

% RQ1: Do computing students feel that climate change will impact how their field of expertise works? RQ2: If they do, what do computing students think their field of expertise will look like during the effects of climate change?
