  abstract = {Climate change is one of the most urgent issues of our time, and the HCI community has shown a growing interest and application in this topic. Considering the communication and interaction challenges it poses, now is an opportune time to analyse how the academic community has explored interaction addressing climate change. Following this premise, we present a visual analysis of the past decade, focusing on HCI research projects that target the general public. For this survey we used the grounded theory review method, resulting in a final corpus of 40 projects, with data visualization as a key step in our investigation.},
