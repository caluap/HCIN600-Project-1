\subsection{Limitations of this study}
For one, time restrictions limited our number of interviewees to only five. While we were able to obtain a varied set of responses, sub-fields of computing were underrepresented, when at all, i.e., we only had one participant from \textsc{hci}, one from game development, etc. Considering how \cite{easterbrook2010climate} proposes sub-field related responses, a broader and more representative sample could deepen the discussion of more specific educational interventions, for instance.

The small sample also meant that we did not achieve data saturation, so while there were common themes between participants' responses, there was also a lot of variety among them. Given our decision to design a short interview guide, more participants would increase confidence in our responses, which as it stands can be seen as tentative.
